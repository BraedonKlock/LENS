# LENS

**Loss-prevention Event Notification System**

LENS is an AI-powered retail loss-prevention system that uses existing security camera feeds to detect suspicious concealment events and notify users with a short video clip for review.

Instead of replacing a store’s current DVR/NVR system, LENS runs alongside it. The existing security system continues handling live viewing and recording, while LENS focuses on event detection, incident clips, and alerts.

## Overview

LENS watches authorized camera feeds in real time and detects suspicious actions such as objects being placed into pockets, bags, or clothing.

When an event is detected, LENS saves a short video clip and sends the incident to a React Native app where the user can review it.

## Architecture

LENS is made up of three main parts:

### LENS Engine

The local engine runs on-site and handles:

- Camera stream connection
- Video processing
- AI inference
- Suspicious event detection
- Incident clip creation
- Local storage
- Sending incidents to the backend

### LENS Backend

The backend handles:

- User accounts
- Store accounts
- Subscriptions
- Incident metadata
- Notifications
- App authentication

### LENS Mobile App

The mobile app is built with **React Native** and handles:

- User login
- Incident notifications
- Incident list
- Video clip review
- Incident status updates

## AI Model

The current proof of concept uses a pretrained video model fine-tuned for suspicious concealment detection.

## MVP Goal

The MVP focuses on the core event-detection workflow:

- Connect to a camera feed
- Run AI inference on video clips
- Detect suspicious concealment events
- Save incident clips
- Send notifications
- Allow users to review clips in the React Native app

Live camera viewing may be added later, but it is not required for the first version.

---

## Status

LENS is currently in proof-of-concept development.

Current focus:

- Training and testing the VideoMAE concealment model
- Running ONNX inference in C++
- Processing video with OpenCV
- Saving suspicious event clips
- Designing the backend and React Native incident-review app
